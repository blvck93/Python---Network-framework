# Python---Network-framework
The script defines a class called network, which encapsulates various network-related functions. It uses several libraries, including "netmiko" for SSH communication with network devices and "icecream" for debugging purposes.

Overall, this script is designed to perform network-related operations such as executing commands on network devices, reading and writing files, and sending syslog messages to a central syslog server. It could be used for network automation and management tasks.
